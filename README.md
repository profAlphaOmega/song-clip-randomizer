# Song Clip Randomizer
```
Hobby Project to let a user upload clips of a song and build a randomized path to play their clips into a song. A user can create an account and upload song clips. They are then presented with an interface to organize, arrange, and set random values to their song clips in order for them to randomize which clips get played one. The clips are then merged together and played as a new randomized continuous file.

Users, authentication, and song clips are stored in Google Cloud's MySql database and Google's Cloud Storage.

This Application utilizes Google's App Engine, Docker, Django, Python, MySQL, Canvas, and other librarys.
